Before anything, open "config.json" and setup the bot with your token, prefix and owner id.
Install "djs-collection-persistent", "discord.js" and "chalk".

After turning on the bot first time, create "commands" and "events" folder to avoid errors.

{prefix} + create - Creates a new command file. ( o!create help )
{prefix} + reload - Reloads a command. ( o!reload help )
